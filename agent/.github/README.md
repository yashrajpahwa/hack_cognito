# Sell Waste Today API

## Overview
Sell Waste Today is a robust, production-grade Express API designed to streamline waste management logistics for Indian enterprises. Our system leverages advanced AI and deterministic logic to ensure reliability, transparency, and operational clarity.

## Key Features
- **Layered Decision Pipeline:** Multi-layer architecture ensures every request is processed through global context, personalized decision, optimization, and final confirmation.
- **Safety Nets:** Deterministic fallbacks and contract-driven responses guarantee that every API call returns a valid, actionable result—even in edge cases or AI failures.
- **Transparent Handling:** All edge cases are managed with explicit, documented logic. When AI is unavailable, the system provides clear, informative placeholder responses.
- **Invariant Messaging:** User-facing messages are consistent and predictable, maintaining trust and clarity for all stakeholders.
